The odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male to female victims
keeping all other variables fixed is 1.1481778

``` r
lower_ci = exp(coef_sex - se_sex)
higher_ci = exp(coef_sex + se_sex)
```

The confidence interval is 1, 1.3183123

``` r

  results %>% filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% pull(estimate)
}

get_se_sex = function(results) {

In Cities from New York, NY to Tulsa, OK, homicides in which the victim
is male are less likely to be resolved than those in which the victim is
female. New York has the lowest OR = 0.2623978, which means homicides in
which the victim is male is significantly less likely to be resolved.

In cities from Atlanta, GA to Albuquerque, NM, homicides in which the
victim is male are more likely to be resolved than those in which the
victim is female. Albuquerque, NM has the highest OR = 1.7674995. which
means homicides in which the victim is male is significantly more likely
to be resolved.
